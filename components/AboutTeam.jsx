            I started Universal Crypto World to solve the problems of the
            investors, as I myself was finding a lot of noise revolving around
            the crypto space which was a fuss. So, I with a few of my friends
            started Metamoonshots to eliminate all the fuss and scams which were
            running to protect the investors and collaborate with new and
            upcoming evolutionary projects.‚Äù.
